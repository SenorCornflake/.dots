# My Configuration files
These are my configuration files, it's as simple as that

# How to install
Simply install a package called "stow", go to your home directory (optional) then clone this repo, cd into and execute the command `stow * -t ~`
This should create symlinks in your `.config` folder which points to the dotfiles repo.

# NOTES
Watch Wolfgangs video to understand how `stow` works, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJBVA4LeJKA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJBVA4LeJKA)
