These are my configuration files, it's as simple as that

# How to install
Run install.py, it creates symbolic links from the repo to your config file. **HOWEVER**, THIS WILL OVERWRITE ANY FILE YOU HAVE WITH THE SAME NAME, so backup.

`install_sys.sh` is for fresh arch installations, it **should** (no promises) install all required programs for these dotfiles
