These are my configuration files, it's as simple as that

# How to install
Run install.sh, it creates symbolic links from the repo to your config file. **HOWEVER**, note that your current dir has to be the root of
the dotfiles repo and that this script will remove any configuration files you might have in order to replace it, so make backups.
